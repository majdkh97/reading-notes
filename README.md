# Growth Mindset 
When someone has a growth mindset they believe that they can continue to learn and become more intelligent with effort.  In contrast, someone who has a fixed mindset believes that they are born with a certain amount of talent and intelligence and that cannot be improved no matter how much effort they put forth.

## Reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset

- Acknowledge and embrace imperfections
- View challenges as opportunities 
- Place effort before talent 

### Inspirational Quote

**in the words of Ray Davis:** 
>A challenge only becomes an obstacle when you bow to it.
